The sidebar mainly consists of two parts: notification center and cutting board. It starts from the start-up and is placed in the tray bar in the form of a tray. After clicking, it can pop up dynamically from the right side of the screen.

  + The notification center can display the pop-up messages sent by each application to mate notification teamon in a list form. Unimportant information can be stored in the storage box for viewing. At the same time, it can call the control panel directly.


  + The main function of the clipboard is to save the latest cutting information, and display it under the sidebar in the form of a list. At the same time, it can also put the previous cutting information at the top, so that it can be pasted directly. In addition, it can record the cut text information as well as the URL.

The ukui-sidebar is a shortcut tool on the right side of the screen for UKUI.
